# Schoodle
*This is the midterm project for lighthouse labs, working in a group for the first time*

### Project Description

[Doodle](https://doodle.com) is great for scheduling events within a group. Your job is to create a simpler, more modern version of it.

#### Requirements:

*   visitors can create an event proposal in much [the same way](http://doodle.com/create) as Doodle, by specifying:
    *   event title and description
    *   their own name and email
*   organizers can then send the unique URL to possible attendees via their own communication workflow (email, Slack, Messenger, etc.)
*   attendees visit the unique URL and:
    *   specify their name and email
    *   specify their availability (yes/no only) for each possible time slot
    *   view all responses including their own
    *   modify their response
*   the unique URL should be secret and thus not use a simple auto-incrementing integer but instead a larger ID that is harder to guess (much like how secret gists work on GitHub)
*   note: this app does not follow the typical user authentication process: users don't need to register or log in and the only way to access the Schoodles is via links

#### Extensions:

*   email notify the event creator every time they receive a new response, with details about what was selected
*   ability to invite participants when creating the event (much like step 4 when creating an event in Doodle)
*   user authentication (not needed for core functionality)
