# This is the midterm project for LHL labs

### We got a lot of things to do, so in no particular order:

 - Role distribution (General guidelines)
    - Front End Design
    - Server Level
    - Databasess
 - File organization
 - Brainstorming
    - Functionality first!
    - I think **Pathways between server and html using ReST convention (routes)** EJS here
    - Database design (ERD), drawn up, mongodb? or should be move to sql?
    - Website design UX
