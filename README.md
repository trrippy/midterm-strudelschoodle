# This is the midterm project for LHL labs

### We got a lot of things to do, so in no particular order:

 - Role distribution (General guidelines)
    - Front End Design
    - Server Level
    - Databases

 - File organization

 - Brainstorming
    - Functionality first!
    - I think **Pathways between server and html using ReST convention (routes)** EJS here
    - Database design (ERD), drawn up, mongodb? or should be move to sql?
    - Website design UX

 - Questions to ask
    - What is the data you can accees or acquire?
    - Can I correlate that data to something else (relationship between data)
    - How can you pivot (the presentation for example) that data to add value

 - Universal values:
    1. Look good
    2. Feel good
    3. Save time
    4. Save money

 - 3 Absolutely key things you gotta do
    1. Pick features/stuff you will build (only build it if you will demo it, you can't bulid everything)
      - User stories (motivation)
        - "as  (a user), I want to (Do something) because (reason)"
      - User scenarios (behavior)
        - "given (something I do on the website) when (i do something) then (response)"

    2. ERD
      - Look over user stories, look at nouns (nouns = tables)

    3. Server framework (node and express)
      - Routes (big mistake)
        - Verbs
        - ReSTful convention
        - GET PUT POST DELETE
        - Params in URLS?
